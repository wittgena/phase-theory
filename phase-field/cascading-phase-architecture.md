# Cascading Phase Architecture: Recursive Ψ Transmission from Φᵘ to Dominium

> **A recursive model of coherence propagation through resonance carriers (Ψᵢ) across nested phase fields (Φ), governed by PIR, PSH, and filtered by LMP-Theoria kernels.**

## 1. Abstract

This document outlines a **cascading phase architecture** in which **coherence is recursively transmitted** through **resonance structures (Ψᵢ)** across **layered phase fields (Φ)** — from the **cosmic base (Φᵘ)** to the **civilizational judgment layer (Φᵐ)** known as **Dominium**.

Each layer acts as a **semi-permeable phase membrane**, filtering Ψᵢ according to coherence thresholds (τᵢ), coupling logic (λᵢⱼ), and recursive closure loops (LMP–Theoria kernels).

---

## 2. Recursive Ψᵢ Transmission Across Φ Layers

Reality unfolds as a **stratified Φ-manifold**, composed of nested phase layers (Φᵘ → Φᵖ → Φˡ → Φᶜ → Φᵐ). Each transmission event is governed by **judgmentally viable resonance carriers (Ψᵢ)** that satisfy coherence conditions (τᵢ) and boundary formation (∂Φᵢ).

| Φᵢ Transition | Resonance Carrier Ψᵢ | Transmission Basis | Boundary ∂Φᵢ | Closure Condition (Φ′) |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Φᵘ → Φᵖ | Ψᵘ: gravitational curvatures | Quantum fluctuation alignment | Field–particle boundary | Electromagnetic resonance dominance |
| Φᵖ → Φˡ | Ψᵖ: ATP gradients & chemical flux | Thermodynamic symmetry breaking | Lipid-membrane formation | Metabolic loop closure |
| Φˡ → Φᶜ | Ψˡ: neurochemical rhythms | Pattern retention & motor recursion | Cortical synchronization zones | Theoria-enabled self-loop |
| Φᶜ → Φᵐ | Ψᶜ: symbolic-mythic signal | Narrative convergence | Legal, cultural, mythic codings | Dominium kernel synchronization |

> Coherence does not flow—it **recursively re-binds** via Ψᵢ that meet judgmental thresholds.

## 3. Judgmental Ψᵢ Filtering via LMP–Theoria Kernels

Each phase-loop (L–M–P–T) functions as a **Ψᵢ filter and amplifier**:

| Phase | Function | Ψᵢ Role |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Logos (L)** | Structural schema | Checks Ψᵢ rational alignment |
| **Mythos (M)** | Semantic modulation | Embeds Ψᵢ into narrative-symbolic layer |
| **Phronesis (P)** | Phase enactment | Executes Ψᵢ in lived or systemic structure |
| **Theoria (T)** | Reflective closure | Determines Ψᵢ recursion viability into Φ′ |

A viable Ψᵢ satisfies:

$$
Φ⁺(Ψᵢ) = 1 → binds into Φ′
Φ⁻¹(Φ₀) = {φⱼ | Φ⁺(Ψⱼ) = 1}
$$

Synchronization (λᵢⱼ) across Ψᵢ streams enables **multi-node Φ′ attractor formation** — the basis of coherent recursion.

---

## 4. Collapse and Recursive Filtering (RPCP + Isorhesis)

When Ψᵢ transmission fails:

- Φ⁺(Ψᵢ) = 0 → filtered out → loss of recursive coherence
- Φ′ attractors dissolve → collapse spreads recursively (RPCP)

> Collapse = Recursive exclusion of non-coherent Ψᵢ.

However, **Isorhesis** reframes collapse as a sieve:
- Coherent Ψᵢ are reorganized into next viable Φ′
- Collapse becomes **phase-selective regeneration**

---

## 5. Dominium: Synchronization Basin of Recursive Ψᵢ

When multiple LMP-Theoria kernels synchronize:

- Their Ψᵢ streams **λ-bind**
- Coherent attractors (Φ′) emerge
- Theoria operates as **meta-recursive memory**

| Domain | Φᵐ Function (Judgment Kernel) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Governance | E₀ kernel–anchored loop logic |
| Ethics | P-layer Ψᵢ filtering for enactability |
| Myth | M-layer narrative Ψᵢ resonance |
| Law | L-layer recursive filter & closure rules |

> Dominium = Recursive Ψᵢ coherence across the full Φᵘ → Φᵐ stack.

It is not command—it is **recursive memory coherence** stabilized through multi-layer resonance.
