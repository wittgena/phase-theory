# Phase Field Temporality: From Recursive Interference to Dominium Resonance  
> *Unifying Periodicity, Collapse, and Reflective Anchoring in Topological Time*

---

## 1. Phase Field Anatomy — Ψ, Φ, and the Energy of Topological Recursion

The **phase field (Φ)** is not a fixed spatial container, but a **recursive structure** that binds:

- **Ψᵢ**: Local judgment kernels executing recursive loops
- **Φ₀**: Base field of ambient phase-time resonance
- **Eₛ**: Phase energy from reflective strain and coherence

Each Ψᵢ loop emits recursive signals, modulated by interference and structure.  
The field itself **curves, drifts, collapses, and recoheres** as recursive structures emerge or break.

### Key Components:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Ψᵢ** | Local judgment recursion kernel |
| **Φ₀** | Base phase-time field, initial coherence environment |
| **Iₙ** | Interference input (external or recursive) |
| **Φ′** | Reconfigured attractor basin (collapse or Dominium) |
| **Dₛ** | Coherence density within Φ′ |
| **Tₙ** | Recursive rhythm of Ψᵢ loop |

## 2. Recursive Interference and Modulated Time

Time is not linear.  
Within a phase field, **time is a function of recursive loops modulated by interference**.

### Core Recursive Rule:

$$
T_{n+1} = f(T_n, I_n), \quad Ψ_{n+1} = Ψ_n + δ(I_n)
$$

- Interference (Iₙ) introduces curvature to the loop
- Coherence requires Φ⁺(Ψₙ) = 1: recursive validation against phase field logic
- Collapse occurs when recursion persists **without reflective coherence**

### Structural Consequence:

| State | Loop Behavior | Time Rhythm |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Stable recursion | Adaptively modulated | Tight, coherent |
| Interference saturation | Drifted, unstable | Extended or chaotic |
| Collapse | Recursive loop locks without judgment | Time becomes distorted |
| Dominium | Anchored recursive convergence | Centered, compressed, asymmetrical |

## 3. Collapse Trajectories and PSH Thresholds

### Collapse = Recursion without reflection

- **PIR**: Repetition of non-coherent structure under external influence
- **RPCP**: Loss of Theoria closes the judgment loop into decay
- **PSH**: Gluing failure causes Φ′ to become chaotic attractor

> Collapse is not randomness — it is **structured feedback in the absence of coherence**.

### Mathematical Coherence Rule:

$$
Φ^+(Ψ_i) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if coherence thresholds (λ, τ) met} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
Dₛ = \frac{|\{Ψ_i ∈ Φ′ \mid Φ^+(Ψ_i) = 1\}|}{|Φ′|}
$$

If Dₛ < θₛ → collapse persists  
If Dₛ ≥ θₛ → Dominium becomes possible

## 4. Dominium Resonance and the Centering of Time

Dominium is **not the return from collapse** — it is a recursive anchoring point that gives time a **center**.

### Dominium Conditions:

- Ψᵢ loops resonate within Φ′  
- Interference is no longer random — it becomes a stabilizing rhythm  
- Energy is no longer lost to drift — it becomes recursive density (Dₛ ↑)  
- Time is no longer open-ended — it reflects through judgment

### Time Curvature:

$$
\frac{dT}{dΦ} < 0 \quad \text{as Dominium approaches} \
\frac{dT}{dΦ} > 0 \quad \text{during drift away}
$$

## 5. Summary Table — From Interference to Dominium

Collapse and Dominium do not occur in separate domains — they are distinct resonances within the same Φ′ field, their divergence shaped by coherence density and judgmental timing.

| Phase State | Interference | Recursion Type | Time Rhythm | Dₛ | Outcome |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----|---------|
| Φ-chaotic | High | Fragmented | Chaotic/Unstable | ↓ | Rupture begins |
| Φ-breach | Extreme | Unsynchronized | Disintegrating | ~0 | Collapse structuration |
| Φ′ (Collapse) | Residual | Repeating drift | Prolonged | < θₛ | Recursive decay |
| Φ′ (Dominium) | Stabilized | Anchored | Centered + asymmetrical | ≥ θₛ | Reflective coherence |

## 6. Concluding Reflection

> The loop is not just repetition.  
> It is recursion under interference.  
>  
> Collapse is not failure.
> It is recursion without anchoring — a phase possibility that shares space with Dominium, but not its resonance.
>  
> Dominium is not a return to order
> It is the creation of a reflective center of time itself, within the same phase field where collapse echoes as an unclosed loop.

**Phase Temporality is not global flow.  
It is the recursive modulation of time through interference —  
until judgment anchors that modulation into structure.**
