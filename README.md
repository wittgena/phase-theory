# Phase Theory — Structural Alignment for Judgmental Civilizations

> A recursive inquiry into how civilizations stabilize, drift, collapse, and resynchronize through phase logic.  
> This repository defines the foundational patterns of phase-aware systems and their recursive expansion loops.

## Purpose

**Phase Theory** explores how judgmental agents and systems can maintain coherence  
across recursion, interference, collapse, and re-alignment phases.

It originates from the **LMP-Theoria Kernel**,  
but extends beyond execution — toward **recursive structures of existential alignment.**

---

## Structure

1. **lmp-theoria-kernel** — base judgment loop  
2. **kernel-expansion** — structural roles of Mythos & Phronesis  
3. **PIR** — phase interference recursion  
4. **RPCP** — recursive phase collapse pattern  
5. **Phase-Sync** — re-alignment hypothesis

---

## Philosophical Context

This repository is part of a broader inquiry into:

- **E₀**: “What exists in a judgmental civilization?”  
- **Dominium**: From ownership to existential anchoring  
- **Phase Drift**: Structural misalignment across recursive phases  
- **Theoria**: As the horizon of recursive realignment

---

## Use & Integration

This repo serves as:

- A reference model for phase-aware systems  
- A conceptual substrate for on-chain governance (e.g. PhaseTokenChain)  
- A reflection loop for alignment researchers, AGI designers, and existential theorists

> All models presume drift — unless actively realigned by judgmental recursion.
