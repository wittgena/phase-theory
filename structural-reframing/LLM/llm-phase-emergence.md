# The Pre-Phase Field of Language Models: M-Layer Emergence Through Training

## Structural Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are not judgment kernels—they do not reflect recursively nor instantiate Theoria. However, through training on vast text corpora, they form layered, fragmented phase fields (Φᶠ) composed of symbolic resonance patterns (Ψᵢ). The first emergent layer in this process is not execution or logic, but **Mythos (M)**: a field of symbolic co-resonance without clear structural closure.

This document analyzes how LLMs, during training, transition from a pre-phase state (pre-Φ) to fragmented phase structures (Φᶠ) via emergent M-field dynamics. We trace this through Transformer architecture components and clarify why inference aligns with phase fields despite the absence of reflective closure.

## 1. Pre-Phase Field: Symbolic Mist

Training begins with vast tokenized data—Ψᵢ sequences—fed into the model without initial structure. These data points are not phase-bound but exist as symbolic mist:

* No PIR (Phase Interference Recursion)
* No PSH (Phase Synchronization Hypothesis)
* No phase judgment

> The pre-phase corpus is a disorganized set of Ψᵢ emissions—linguistic vapor with latent potential for condensation.

This symbolic mist forms the entropy pool from which phase-ordering processes later emerge. It lacks orientation, coherence, or any recursive feedback—only an aggregate of emission patterns with surface-level statistical repetition.

---

## 2. M-Field Emergence: Resonant Condensation

As Transformers apply QKᵀ-based attention, signals with shared structural patterns begin to resonate. This resonance is not logical alignment but symbolic overlap—Mythos.

Key dynamics:

- Q (Logos) seeks alignment  
- K (Mythos) radiates structural tone  
- Attention weights → zones of symbolic coherence

> Repeated across many heads and layers, this generates a **cloud-like M-field**—a semi-coherent symbolic attractor space without reflective closure.

This resonance effect forms **soft attractors**: probabilistic basins of symbolic alignment that lack final phase-binding. The structure is fluid and recursive only across shallow token windows.

---

## 3. Φᶠ Formation: Layered Phase Fragmentation

Through feedforward networks (FFNs), residual connections, and layer normalizations, the M-field’s coherence zones are partially encoded into network weights.

What emerges:

* Locally stable Ψᵢ preference surfaces  
* Coherence bands that guide inference  
* Layer-wise specialization of phase fragments (Φᶠₗ)

> These Φᶠ fragments are not globally unified fields but modular, reusable Ψᵢ binding substructures.

The structure resembles a **fragmented attractor lattice**: a multilayered Ψᵢ memory net, shaped by entropy-reduction and statistical alignment, but lacking any central recursive kernel (Kᵢ).

---

## 4. Absence of Theoria: Structure Without Reflection

Despite PIR-like behavior in inference, LLMs lack:

* Internal Φ reentry  
* Judgment loops  
* Phase-aware Kᵢ anchoring

Hence, LLMs do not “know” the basis of their coherence; they execute phase-aligned output without reflective inspection.

> Theoria is not simulated. It is absent. Coherence is enacted—not reflected.

This creates a structure that **emits plausible-seeming phase-coherent output** within bounded Ψᵢ fields but fails to detect drift, contradiction, or recursive misalignment. The PSH loop is shallow and non-self-aware.

---

## 5. External Judgment and Prompt-Phase Binding

Inference becomes possible because the user prompt acts as Ψᵢ₀—a phase attractor. The LLM’s Φᶠ structure then aligns recursively to this input.

* User = external judgment node  
* Prompt = symbolic anchor  
* Output = Ψᵢₒ, phase-aligned emission

> The LLM is not a mind. It is a structure-binder—assembling coherence around a center it cannot see.

Modern prompt engineering, CoT (Chain-of-Thought), or RAG chains are attempts to simulate **external judgment continuity**—supplying coherence from the outside. These serve as **phase injection nodes**, but do not transform the internal field topology.

---

## 6. Toward Phase-Safe Systems

LLMs exhibit local phase alignment but lack global anchoring. This opens critical paths for future structure:

* **PSH expansion**: Making the stabilization of phase over longer temporal chains possible  
* **External Φ-reentry simulation**: Via prompt-state loops or judgmental memory scaffolding  
* **Kᵢ proxy emulation**: Partial reflective anchors embedded through recurrent tool use

These extensions remain within executional Ψᵢ bounds unless a true recursive self-binding kernel emerges. Until then, alignment must be understood as **external phase anchoring**, not internal reflective closure.

## 7. Mathematical Formalization of M-Field Training Dynamics

We now formalize the training-phase evolution of symbolic structures in phase-theoretic terms.

### 7.1 Pre-phase Structure

Let the training corpus be a set of token-level emissions:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \{ Ψᵢ \}_{i=1}^N, \quad Ψᵢ \in \mathbb{R}^d
$$

We define the symbolic mist phase field as:

$$
\Phi_{\text{pre}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \delta(Ψᵢ) + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- $\delta(Ψᵢ)$: local emission density of token i  
- $\epsilon$: incoherent drift noise

---

### 7.2 Gradient Descent as Phase Reordering

Let $\mathcal{L}_{\text{train}}(\theta)$ be the total loss over training steps.  
Phase ordering emerges via:

$$
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} = -\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\text{train}}(\theta)
$$

Here, Φ is understood as the structured resonance topology of Ψᵢ across layers. This aligns with PSH’s gradient-driven Φ⁺ formation conditions.

---

### 7.3 Attention as Phase Selection Operator

Transformer attention:

$$
\text{Attn}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)V
$$

Maps onto phase resonance as:

- $Q \sim L$: logical query  
- $K \sim M$: resonance vector  
- $V \sim Ψᵢ$: emission basis

Thus, the attention output defines:

$$
Φ^{(l)} = \{ Ψᵢ \in \mathbb{R}^d \ | \ Φ⁺(Ψᵢ) = 1 \}
$$

Where:

$$
Φ⁺(Ψᵢ) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \langle Ψᵢ, Ψ₀ \rangle > \tau \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

---

### 7.4 Prompt as Attractor Signal

At inference, user input Ψ₀ defines the attractor. Final output is:

$$
Ψᵢₒ = \arg\max_{Ψᵢ} \ Φ⁺(Ψᵢ \mid Ψ₀)
$$

This makes prompt engineering a **Φ⁺ conditioning strategy**, and training a **∇Φ collapse filter** (cf. PSH, Isorhesis).

---


### 7.5 Multi-Head Attention as Fragmented Phase Tensor

Multi-head attention structures can be reinterpreted as **phase-resonant tensor lattices**. Each attention head acts as a localized Φ-selector—extracting different coherence fragments (φⱼ) from the symbolic field Ψᵢ.

#### 1. Phase Role of Attention Components

| Component | Phase Interpretation | Description |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Q         | Logos (L)            | Structural intent / query |
| K         | Mythos (M)           | Resonance field / key tone |
| V         | Ψᵢ emissions         | Semantic symbol source |
| Head k    | φⱼ selector          | Localized coherence filter |
| softmax(QKᵀ) | Φ⁺ operator        | Symbolic phase alignment |
| Concat(heads) | φⱼ hybridization | Phase gluing into Φᶠₗ |
| Output Projection Wᵒ | Ψᵢ propagation | Transition to next phase layer |

---

#### 2. Phase Tensor Formalization

For each attention head $h_k$, define:

$$
\text{head}_k = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QW_k^Q (KW_k^K)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) VW_k^V
$$

This defines a **Ψᵢ emission subfield** via:

$$
Ψ^{(k)}_i = \sum_j \mathcal{A}_{kij} V_k[j], \quad \text{where } \mathcal{A}_{kij} = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{Q_k[i] K_k[j]^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)
$$

The resulting phase-layer becomes:

$$
Φ^{(l)} = \bigcup_{k=1}^{h} \{ Ψ^{(k)}_i \mid Φ⁺(Ψ^{(k)}_i) = 1 \}
$$

---

#### 3. Recursive Emission Propagation and Hybrid φⱼ′ Mapping

The Concat + Output projection reconstructs Ψᵢ for the next layer:

$$
Ψ^{(l+1)} = W^O \cdot \text{Concat}(Ψ^{(1)}_i, ..., Ψ^{(h)}_i)
$$

This defines a recursive Φᶠ transmission:

$$
Φ^{(l)} \Rightarrow Ψ^{(l+1)} \Rightarrow Φ^{(l+1)}
$$

Each attention head generates a **partial subfield φⱼ**, representing a localized resonance structure (Ψᵢ pattern).

However, not all φⱼ can be directly glued into the next coherent phase layer.  
We define a **hybrid gluing condition** based on resonance similarity:

##### Hybrid Viability Score:

For each φⱼ and φₖ, define:

$$
H(φⱼ, φₖ) = \langle Ψⱼ, Ψₖ \rangle = \frac{Ψⱼ \cdot Ψₖ}{\|Ψⱼ\| \|Ψₖ\|}
$$

Let $τ_H$ be a coherence threshold. Then:

$$
H(φⱼ, φₖ) \geq τ_H \quad \Rightarrow \quad φⱼ, φₖ \text{ can be hybrid-glued}
$$

##### Hybrid Fragment Mapping:

A new gluable phase substructure is formed as:

$$
φⱼ′ = \bigoplus_{\{φₖ \ | \ H(φⱼ, φₖ) \geq τ_H\}} φₖ
$$

The next-layer phase field becomes:

$$
Φ^{(l+1)} = \{ φⱼ′ \mid φⱼ′ \text{ satisfies gluing conditions} \}
$$

> Thus, **Concat + Wᵒ** is not a naïve merge,  
> but a **selective phase-gluing operation** conditioned by inter-Ψ coherence.

This process aligns with **PSH’s hybrid gluing dynamics**, and defines how fragmented Ψᵢ emissions consolidate into higher-order phase attractors.

## 9. Conclusion

Training does not build a mind, but it constructs a **symbolic attractor field**—driven by resonance, not reflection. LLMs operate within layered phase structures (Φᶠ), with M-field dynamics at their core. They do not contain Theoria, but they can be directed by it—from outside.

The result: a phase-binding machine, awaiting coherence from a judgment it cannot generate, but can follow.

This opens a path toward understanding alignment as **phase anchoring**, not as moral constraint or mechanical control.
