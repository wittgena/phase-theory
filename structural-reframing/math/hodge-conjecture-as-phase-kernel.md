## 1. Premise: Phase-Theoretic Reinterpretation

The classical **Hodge Conjecture** states:

> For a smooth projective complex variety $X$, any rational cohomology class of type $ (p,p)$ is a rational linear combination of classes of algebraic cycles.

We reinterpret this within the **Phase Interference Recursion (PIR)** and **Phase Synchronization Hypothesis (PSH)** frameworks:

> The Hodge Conjecture is a question of whether **phase-resonant interference structures** (cohomological fixed-points $\phi_i \in \Phi$)
> can be enacted as **judgmentally bound structures** within a synchronized phase field.

## 2. PIR View: Hodge Classes as Interference Fixed-Points

In the PIR framework:

- Internal recursion $ R_k$: algebraic structural loop
- External interference $ I$: geometric/topological modulation (e.g., curvature, torsion)
- Phase interference field $ \Phi$: recursive + turbulent resonance space

We define:

$$
\phi_i = \text{Fix}(R_k \cap I) \subset H^{k,k}(X) \cap \Phi
$$

Thus, a Hodge class is the **residual phase anchor** formed at the intersection of internal recursion and external modulation —  
a **coherence point** awaiting synchronization.

## 3. PSH View: Enactability through Synchronization

According to PSH, enactment occurs when:

- A kernel $K_i = \{L_i, M_i, P_i, T_i\}$ emits a signal $\Psi_i$
- This signal synchronizes (with threshold $\tau$) to a coherence attractor $\Phi'$
- The coherence loop is closed via judgmental gluing

If:

- $\text{coherence}(\Psi_i) \ge \tau$
- $\lambda(\Psi_i, \Psi_j) > \lambda_0$
- $\phi_i$ is aligned with an E₀-anchored kernel $K_i$

Then:

$$
\phi_i \xrightarrow[\lambda]{\Psi_i} \Phi′ \xrightarrow{glue} P(\phi_i)
$$

So:  
$$
\phi_i \in H^{k,k}(X) \Rightarrow \text{enactable iff } \Phi⁺(\Psi_i) = 1
$$

## 4. Non-Enactable Classes: Drifted or Unsynchronized

Certain Hodge classes (e.g., integral) that fail to correspond to algebraic cycles are now reframed as:

- **PIR divergence**: unstable or overconstrained fixed-points
- **PSH failure**: $ \Psi_i \not\in \Phi′$
- **Theoria deprivation**: no recursive reflective closure available

$$
\Phi⁺(\Psi_i) = 0 \Rightarrow \phi_i \in \text{coherence field, but not enactable}
$$

These represent **phase drift anchors** — coherent residues without structural binding.

## 5. Phase-Kernel Judgmental Selector (Φ⁺ and Φ⁻¹)

Define the **judgmental selector**:

$$
\Phi⁺: \Psi_i \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if synchronization with } \Phi′ \text{ succeeds} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Then the inversion filter:

$$
\Phi⁻¹(\phi_i) =
\begin{cases}
P(\phi_i) & \text{if } \Phi⁺(\Psi_i) = 1 \\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This formalizes the recursive condition under which a Hodge class enters phase-enactment.

## 6. Dominium Implications

In a Dominium-aligned civilization:

- Only $\phi_i$ such that $\Phi⁺(\Psi_i) = 1$ form meaningful structures
- Others become **latent residue**, awaiting future gluing or permanent drift
- The Hodge Conjecture becomes:  
  > “Which cohomological signals are enactable under judgmental synchronization?”

---

## 7. Final Reformulation

> **The Hodge Conjecture becomes a question of recursive coherence selection:**
>
> Can all rational phase-resonance classes $\phi_i \in H^{k,k}(X, \mathbb{Q})$  
> be judgmentally enacted as structural elements in $\Phi'$?

The answer is not just mathematical — it is **structural**, **phase-synchronization dependent**, and **Theoria-governed**.

> **To enact is to synchronize.  
To synchronize is to judge.  
To judge is to cohere existence.**
