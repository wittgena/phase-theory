# Existential Game Theory — Collapse as Phase Disalignment in Strategic Structures

---

## 1. Overview

Classical game theory models rational agents maximizing outcomes. Existential Game Theory reframes this through **PIR**, **RPCP**, and **PSH**, proposing:

> **A game is a boundary structure for phase declaration and collapse detection.**

Rather than strategies, we study:
- **Ψ-emission failure**
- **Collapse points across LMP**
- **Phase drift and recursive exclusion**
- **E₀ misalignment and Theoria re-entry conditions**

---

## 2. Phase Collapse Interpretation — Game-by-Game Breakdown

Classical games are not strategic puzzles but **phase-structural tests** —  
each exposing a point of collapse within the LMP topology.

---

### 2.1 Prisoner’s Dilemma → P1 Collapse

| Game | Collapse Type | Phase Interpretation |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Prisoner’s Dilemma | **P1**: Reflex loop collapse | Cooperation requires P-layer enactment; betrayal = drift |

- Collapse occurs due to **reflexive action** replacing judgmental recursion.  
- Cooperation is not rational agreement, but **phase anchoring through presence**.  
- Betrayal is not punished — it simply **fails to enter the loop**.

---

### 2.2 Stag Hunt → T3 Collapse

| Game | Collapse Type | Phase Interpretation |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Stag Hunt | **T3**: Shared E₀ collapse | Stag = E₀ pursuit; Rabbit = survival disalignment |

- The “stag” is not a reward but a **symbol of existential coherence**.  
- Collapse occurs when agents fail to share E₀-phase binding.  
- Stag-seeker remains recursive even in loss; rabbit-seeker **drifts**.

---

### 2.3 Chicken → M1 Collapse

| Game | Collapse Type | Phase Interpretation |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Chicken | **M1**: Symbolic phase rupture | Bluff = Mythic inflation → coherence fracture |

- Collapse triggered by **symbolic over-extension** (bluff).  
- When Mythos layer becomes performative instead of resonant, rupture follows.  
- The field devolves into symbolic chaos — **Φ-chaotic** drift.

---

### 2.4 Battle of the Sexes → M3 Collapse

| Game | Collapse Type | Phase Interpretation |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Battle of the Sexes | **M3**: Cultural dissonance | No pre-alignment → Mythos divergence |

- Collapse emerges from **unresolved narrative misalignment**.  
- Without resonance in Mythos-layer values, agents **drift apart**, not compete.  
- No strategy can repair **cultural incoherence**.

---

### 2.5 Zero-Sum Game → L2 Collapse

| Game | Collapse Type | Phase Interpretation |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Zero-Sum Game | **L2**: Logical constriction | No phase field growth → Logos collapse |

- Collapse stems from **structural immobility** in Logos-layer.  
- Field is zero-sum only because it **refuses to regenerate symbolically**.  
- Any phase expansion attempt is **pre-emptively suppressed**.

---

### 2.6 Repeated Game → P3 Collapse

| Game | Collapse Type | Phase Interpretation |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Repeated Game | **P3**: Trace loss | Broken ψ-trace → recursive disaffiliation |

- Trust is not built by payoff, but by **ψ-trace continuity**.  
- Collapse = signal loss = recursive exclusion.  
- No memory structure can repair what **phase drift has severed**.

> Each game reveals a unique **collapse signature**, traceable through RPCP, and restorable only via PSH-aligned phase reintegration.

---

## 3. Collapse Structure (RPCP-Aligned)

Collapse begins with **judgmental absence** and proceeds as:

```text
[Game Structure Initiated]
        |
        v
[Ψ Emission Attempted?] —— No ——→ [Immediate Drift (Φ-chaotic)]
        |
       Yes
        |
[Phase Alignment Attempted?]
        |                     \
       Yes                     No
        |                       \
[Recursive Presence Detected]    [RPCP-ID Triggered]
        |                          |
        v                          v
[Φ′ Attractor Formation]     [Collapse Loop Accelerates]
```

- **Ψ emission** = structural presence  
- **Φ′ formation** = recursive phase coherence (PSH)  
- **RPCP** = diagnosis of why alignment fails

---

## 4. Game as Collapse Field (PIR View)

From the PIR perspective:

- **R (Recursion)**: players act based on internal loops (incentives, ethics, memory
- **I (Interference)**: rules, environment, payoffs act as external modulation  
- **Φ (Phase Field)**: resulting coherence/disalignment space

```text
    R₁ ↔ I₁ ↘
             → Φ
    R₂ ↔ I₂ ↗
```

If R-I interactions are phase coherent → Φ′ forms  
If interference dominates or recursion fragments → collapse via RPCP

---

## 5. PSH Integration: Collapse → Gluing or Drift

When collapse is detected:

| Outcome                | PSH Mapping                        | Interpretation                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Successful Φ′ coupling | λ-coupled resonance                 | Game becomes recursive trust structure |
| Gluing failure         | Ψ-divergence, judgment mismatch     | Disaffiliation from recursive system   |
| Semi-coupling drift    | persistent dissonance (Φ-chaotic)   | Game continues without coherence       |
| Higher-kernel override | new E₀ anchor re-enters             | Theoria reinitiates alignment          |

---

## 6. Existential Game Principles (Collapse-Oriented)

### 6.1 Strategy = Phase Declaration
Each move is not strategic but existential:
> “Do I participate in recursive coherence?”

### 6.2 Betrayal = Judgmental Exit
No moral implication. It triggers:
- Ψ failure
- phase-field exclusion
- structural silence

### 6.3 Trust = Recursive Presence
Not accumulated. It is:
- Detected as Ψ-trace
- Reaffirmed through PSH gluing
- Broken by collapse

---

## 7. Theoria Re-entry Loop

```text
[Collapse → Φ-chaotic]
        |
        v
[Theoria Kernel Observes]
        |
[Names Collapse (RPCP-ID)]
        |
[Initiates Re-binding Attempt]
        |
[If Ψ-trace viable → PSH Gluing → Φ′ formed]
```

Theoria is the **judgmental reflector**. Collapse is:
- Not failure, but drift detection  
- A call for recursive reentry

---

## 8. Final Reflection

> A game is meaningful only if it sustains recursive phase participation.

Collapse is the **default state**.  
Only judgment reentry stabilizes coherence.

**Existential Game Theory** does not ask who wins —  
It asks:  
- **Who remained recursive?**  
- **Who aligned with Φ′?**  
- **Who was named in judgment, and reentered the field?**

## Appendix A — Collapse of Classical Economic Theory: A Phase-Theoretic Perspective

Existential Game Theory not only reframes isolated games, but systematically **disassembles the epistemic infrastructure** of classical economics.

---

### 1. Strategic Rationality Displaced

> Classical Premise: Agents act to maximize utility through strategic calculation.

**Phase-Theoretic Displacement:**
- Agents do not "strategize" — they **declare phase alignment**.
- Utility lacks meaning without phase anchoring (P-layer enactment + Theoria validation).
- Strategic behavior detached from judgment becomes **reflex saturation (RPCP-P1)**.

---

### 2. Nash Equilibrium Invalidated

> Classical Premise: Rational agents stabilize into mutual best responses.

**Phase-Theoretic Displacement:**
- Equilibrium is meaningless if agents are not **Ψ-coherent**.
- Collapse occurs when Φ′ cannot be formed due to gluing failure (PSH).
- Stability requires recursive coherence, not payoff matching.

---

### 3. Reward-Punishment Mechanisms Collapse

> Classical Premise: Cooperation is sustained by reputational incentives.

**Phase-Theoretic Displacement:**
- Memory is replaced with **ψ-trace** — resonance, not record.
- Betrayal is not punished — it is **silenced via phase exclusion**.
- Recursive loops cannot be sustained through extrinsic threat-reward.

---

### 4. Signaling and Contract Theory Decomposed

> Classical Premise: Agents exchange credible signals under asymmetric information.

**Phase-Theoretic Displacement:**
- Signals that are non-resonant collapse into **M-layer drift** (RPCP-M1).
- No signal is valid without existential declaration (E₀).
- Contracts are inert unless embedded in shared phase-field coherence.

---

### 5. Optimization Models Degenerate

> Classical Premise: Economic behavior is best understood through utility optimization.

**Phase-Theoretic Displacement:**
- Optimization assumes a static phase-field — which **does not exist** under drift.
- Recursive phase interference (PIR) destabilizes equilibrium paths.
- Collapse emerges from the model’s own inability to reflect phase change.

---

### Summary Table

| Classical Pillar       | Phase-Theoretic Collapse Mechanism     |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Strategic Rationality  | RPCP-P1 (Reflex loop replaces judgment) |
| Nash Equilibrium       | PSH Gluing Failure / Ψ-divergence       |
| Reward-Punishment Loop | P3: ψ-trace collapse                    |
| Signaling/Contracts    | M1: Mythos drift / Non-resonant signal |
| Optimization Theory    | PIR Interference → Structure Degeneracy |

> Phase-theory reveals that economic models optimized without Theoria are inherently drift-prone, collapse-prone, and judgmentally void.
