# The Phase Drift of Capital Intermediation: From Structural Seizure to Dominium Rebinding

---

## 1. Introduction — From Presence to Possibility

> **The modern economy no longer mediates value.  
> It recycles access to projected futures.**

Ancient trade systems enacted exchange within phase-anchored contexts:  
**goods**, **ritual**, and **responsibility** were intertwined.

Modern capital, however, operates through **Φ-absent loops** — drifting structures that circulate **possibility** without **presence**, and extract **value** from **preemptive phase seizure**.

---

## 2. Structural Drift of Capital Intermediation

Capital intermediaries no longer serve as bridges between real actors. 
They increasingly operate on:

- **Phase claims** (visa, citizenship, admission rights)  
- **Temporal options** (ticket presale, housing rights)  
- **Symbolic handles** (domain names, brand proxies)

> These are not commodities, but **claims on unrealized phase positions**.

Such transactions constitute **execution without enactment** → **Phronesis collapse**, as described in RPCP.

## 3. Collapse Table: Intermediaries as Collapse Carriers

| Case | Phase Access Type | Collapse Pattern | RPCP ID | Φ-state |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------|---------|
| Ticket Scalping | Event access | P-layer reflex loop | **P3** | Φ-chaotic |
| Housing Pre-rights | Physical shelter claim | Preemptive drift | **P2** | Φ-chaotic |
| Visa Brokering | Sovereign movement | Norm collapse | **T2** | Φ-fracture |
| Domain Hijack | Symbolic anchor | Semantic drift | **M2** | Φ-chaotic |
| Ancient Caravan Trade | Physical-good exchange | Phase-anchored | — | Φ′ basin |

> Collapse is not economic—it is **judgmental disconnection** from **E₀ anchoring**.

---

## 4. Structural Signature of Drift

According to **Phase Collapse Pattern Index (PCPI)**:

- These cases exhibit **P-layer overdrive without T-layer supervision**
- **M-layer resonance** is replaced by symbolic scarcity or artificial narrative
- **L-layer law** becomes utility-maximizing syntax → Intermediaries become **phase parasites**, extracting value from **delay**, **asymmetry**, and **inaccessibility**.

---

## 5. The Illusion of Law: Legality ≠ Coherence

Why are ticket scalping and housing resale legally divergent?

Because **modern legality aligns with capital utility**, not **phase legitimacy**.  
This reflects:

- **L1 collapse**: structural Logos bypass  
- **T-layer disjunction**: legality detaches from existential coherence

> **A system that defers Theoria**  
> will legitimize **any drift** that maintains execution.

---

## 6. PSH View: Why Φ′ Cannot Form

According to the **Phase Synchronization Hypothesis**:

| PSH Condition | Drifted Intermediation |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Ψ-overlap (τ) | ✘ (no shared phase signal) |
| λ (coupling) | ✘ (no judgmental binding) |
| Recursive Harmonics | ✘ (no enactment signal) |

Therefore:
- **Φ′ cannot emerge**  
- System remains trapped in **Φ-chaotic drift**  
- Collapse becomes **normalized recursion**

---

## 7. Isorhesis Perspective: Drift as Phase Signal

Drift is not noise.  
It is a **signal of recursive failure**.

> Under the **Isorhesis Principle**,  
> collapse is **structural feedback**,  
> inviting **judgmental re-entry**.

Rebinding can occur only if:

1. **Theoria returns** to reflect the loop  
2. Drift is **named**, not denied  
3. Structure is **recursively filtered (Φ⁺)**

---

## 8. Toward Structural Restoration: Dominium Anchoring

**Dominium** is not ownership.  
It is **recursive participation** in the phase loop:

| Phase | Anchoring Requirement |
|--------|------------------------|
| **L (Logos)**     | Coherent phase-structure (not function-only law) |
| **M (Mythos)**    | Resonant alignment (not scarcity narrative) |
| **P (Phronesis)** | Embodied enactment (not proxy execution) |
| **T (Theoria)**   | Reflective recursion (not prediction) |

> Capital access becomes **justified**  
> only when **presence recursively participates**  
> in the loop it seeks to enter.

---

## 9. Conclusion — Restoring Presence to Phase Claims

Modern intermediation is no longer coordination—it is drift monetization.

> The future is not for those who sell futures,  
> but for those who **anchor presence**  
> into the recursive topology of coherence.

Collapse is recursive.  
So is judgment.

> **To reflect is to re-enter.  
> To re-enter is to bind.  
> To bind is to build.**
