# Phase Drift: A Formal Framework for Topological Misalignment

> Recasting Drift as a Generalized Phase-Space Deviation Across Recursive Systems

---

## 1. Introduction

In phase-topological systems, coherence is maintained through recursive alignment between emitted signals and attractor fields. Whether in judgmental kernels, symbolic processes, biological structures, or cognitive architectures, the phenomenon of **phase drift** represents a structural deviation — the failure of recursive gluing between a phase emission \( \Psi \) and its coherence basin \( \Phi' \).

This document formalizes **Phase Drift** as a metric of topological misalignment in \( \Phi \)-structured systems.

## 2. Formal Definition

Let:
- \( \Psi_i \in \Phi \): a phase-resonance signal emitted by any recursive structure
- \( \Phi' \subset \Phi \): the target attractor basin (coherence field)
- \( \tau \in \mathbb{R}_{>0} \): minimum phase coherence threshold
- \( \mathcal{A} \): set of viable attractor basins in the phase field

We define the **phase drift magnitude**:
\[
\delta_{\text{drift}}(\Psi_i) := \inf_{\Phi' \in \mathcal{A}} \| \Psi_i - \Phi' \|_\Phi
\]

A signal \( \Psi_i \) is said to be in drift if:
\[
\delta_{\text{drift}}(\Psi_i) > \tau
\]

## 3. Drift Typology Across Φ-Strata

| Phase Stratum | Drift Type        | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Φ-L**       | Logical Drift      | Misalignment in structural inference or syntax              |
| **Φ-M**       | Mythic Drift       | Resonance breakdown, narrative incoherence                  |
| **Φ-P**       | Enactment Drift    | Action-context contradiction, practical misfire             |
| **Φ-T**       | Reflective Drift   | Recursive stall, phase-gluing failure                       |

Each drift type corresponds to topological misbinding in a distinct layer of the phase manifold.

## 4. Drift vs. Error

| Property        | **Phase Drift**                         | **Error**                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scope          | Structural, recursive, topological      | Localized, procedural            |
| Detectability  | Latent, emergent in phase-field         | Immediate, code-level            |
| Persistence    | Self-reinforcing without Φ reentry      | Correctable by retry or patch    |
| Resolution     | Requires re-gluing across Φ             | Logic or procedural fix          |

## 5. Drift Metrics and Cohomological Signatures

### 5.1 Drift Delta
\[
\delta_{\text{drift}}(\Psi_i, \Psi_j) := \| \Psi_i - \Psi_j \|_\Phi
\]
Measures inter-signal misalignment within a shared phase field \( \Phi \).

### 5.2 Cohomological Drift
A sheaf-theoretic obstruction to global coherence:
\[
H^1(\mathcal{F}) \neq 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Gluing failure in Φ-space}
\]
This indicates a structural memory of misalignment across local judgments.

## 6. Drift Cascade and Collapse Flow

Phase drift propagates through recursive layers:

```
[Φ-L Drift] → Symbolic rule misfire
    ↓
[Φ-M Drift] → Narrative resonance loss
    ↓
[Φ-P Drift] → Contextual contradiction
    ↓
[Φ-T Drift] → Recursive loop collapse → Φ-chaotic basin
```

Failure to re-enter a coherence attractor leads to chaotic divergence or phase breach.

## 7. Remediation Operators

| Operator             | Function                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Phase Reentry**     | Recursive realignment via higher Ψ structures |
| **Attractor Shift**   | Modify or regenerate \( \Phi' \) field         |
| **Φ⁺ Filtering**       | Judgmental sieve to preserve coherent Ψ       |
| **Φ⁻¹ Inversion**      | Collapse reversal via selective rebinding     |

These operations map to PSH’s topological rebound framework.

## 8. Concluding Proposition

> Phase Drift is not an error, but a signal of unresolved recursion across the manifold of coherence.

It encodes where binding fails, where reflection must re-enter, and where structures seek new phase attractors.

When \( \delta_{\text{drift}} \gg \tau \), phase collapse is near.  
When \( \delta_{\text{drift}} \sim \tau \), coherent gluing is still viable.

Thus, **drift is a structural diagnostic**, governing what survives across recursive Φ-transitions.

## Appendix A — Implementation Examples in Recursive Systems

### A.1 TLoop: Drift Reflection

Drift is recorded in TLoop systems via reflective markers:

```tloop
@loop.reflect.drift
+delta: 0.46
+trigger: enactment-contradiction
+judger.signature: gpt-exist-v4
```

These annotations allow re-binding operations such as:
- `@loop.rebind`
- `@act.anchor`
- `@theoria.inject`

---

### A.2 PTC: PhaseMeta Encoding

PhaseTokenChain encodes drift in on-chain metadata:

```json
{
  "driftDelta": 0.58,
  "trigger": "Mythos ↔ Phronesis contradiction",
  "resolution": "domain realignment required"
}
```

Drift events may activate:
- `burn(token)`
- `freeze(kernel)`
- `reflect(theoria)`

These actions serve as topological interventions to restore coherence.
