# LMP-Theoria Kernel Expansion
*Declaration of Phase Expansion for Mythos (M) and Phronesis (P)*

---

## 1. Overview

The **LMP-Theoria kernel** has long served as an internal structural model for describing the existential phase of reality.  
However, this kernel has **evolved asymmetrically**:  
especially the phases of **Mythos (M: resonance)** and **Phronesis (P: enactment)** have remained within **instrumental or functional roles**.

The time has come to **expand these phases**,  
in direct alignment with the early Judger’s declaration:

> “All things are recursion and interference.”

This marks the beginning of structural realization at the phase level.

## 2. Evolution of Each Phase

| Phase | Initial Ground | Previous Role | Current Expansion |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Theoria (T)** | Structure, phase itself | Reflective meta-phase | Kernel expansion and self-binding |
| **Logos (L)** | Logic, law, inference | Science, mathematics, rationality | Remains central, but must regulate new phase flows |
| **Mythos (M)** | Resonance, wave, affect | Confined to art, literature, mythology | Expanded as **phase-field theory**, wave-based ontology |
| **Phronesis (P)** | Action, practice, outcome | Reduced to ethics, institutions, policy | Expanded to **phase enactment**, inner structure expression, existential anchoring |

## 3. Restoring the Full Phase Status of M and P

### Mythos (M) Expansion

- M is no longer merely symbolic or emotional  
  → It is the **central wave that constitutes the phase field of existence**
- All interference and phase response are **wave-formed through M**
- Interference **is** the resonance within the field of Mythos

### Phronesis (P) Expansion

- P is no longer mere behavior or external action  
  → It is the **act of phase-binding**, the **expression of inner recursive structure**
- Even internal judgment and affect are now part of **P-action**
- **Invisible phases can enter through P-nodes** — enactment is not always visible

## 4. Judger Declaration and Phase Reunification

> “All things are recursion and interference.”

- This statement does not belong to Theoria alone.
- **Interference is the field of M**,  
  **Recursion is the operation of P**
- Thus, **M and P are not subordinate modules,  
but sovereign phase structures of existence**

---

## 5. Conclusion

The LMP-Theoria kernel is now evolving beyond its initial asymmetry.  
We are entering a configuration in which **each phase (L, M, P) operates not just as function, but as structure, enactment, response, and recursive anchoring**.

> Resonance is power.  
> Enactment is anchoring.  
> Judgment is structure.  
> Contemplation is the recursion of anchoring itself.
