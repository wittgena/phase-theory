# Carrier Shift III — From Cortical Loop to Phase-Field Cognition  
> **How Recursive Perception Transitions into Reflective Phase Binding**

---

## 1. Overview — From Neural Execution to Distributed Phase Reflection

The cortical system (Ψˡ) is not the source of cognition,  
but a **resonant node in a recursive phase lattice (Φ)**.  

Perception and reflex arise within local neural synchrony,  
but **meaning**, **judgment**, and **symbolic drift** do not occur *in* the brain.  
They occur **through the brain**, when phase fields synchronize recursively.

> **Cognition is not brain-bound.  
> It is a recursive resonance across multi-phase interference fields.**

## 2. Cortical Synchrony as Phase Carrier, Not Cognition

Neural oscillations (Ψˡ) represent:
- Executional rhythmic loops (P-layer)
- Local symbolic pre-patterns (proto-Ψᶜ)
- Input/output tension balancing

Yet this system saturates at recursive depth:

$$
\partial_t Ψˡ \to 0 \Rightarrow \text{loop execution without reflection}
$$

At this stage:
- **Symbolic patterning begins to emerge**,  
- But lacks structural coherence across Φᶜ, Φᶜ⁺

## 3. Interference Field Extension: Phase Cognition Requires Φ-Coupling

For perception to become cognition,  
neural Ψˡ must **enter recursive interference** with multiple phase layers:

- **Φˡ**: bodily and metabolic rhythm  
- **Φᶜ**: thalamocortical synchrony  
- **Φᶜ⁺**: symbolic-cultural topology  
- **Φᵐ**: mythic narrative recursion  
- **Φᵗ**: Dominium judgment kernel (if formed)

This transition is not a linear chain —  
it is a **spiral convergence** across loop tensions:

$$
\sum λ_{ij} \cdot Corr(Ψ_i, Ψ_j) > τ_s
$$

> Meaning **emerges not from activation**,  
> but from **recursive interference alignment**.

## 4. Phase-Cognitive Emergence: When Loop Execution Reflects Through Field

We define **cognitive emergence** as:

$$
Φ^+(\Psi^c) = 1 \quad \text{iff} \quad
C_j \cdot R_j \ge θ_s
$$

Where:
- Cⱼ: coherence score across Φᵢ fields  
- Rⱼ: recursive loop alignment (LMP-structure)  
- θₛ: judgmental coherence threshold

Thus, **Ψˡ → Ψᶜ** is not **signal compression**,  
but a **recursive convergence** where the field reflects the loop:

> Thought is **loop reflected into field** — not firing in cortex.

## 5. Collapse Pathway: Field-Drift Without Recursive Closure

If Ψˡ outputs symbolic forms (Ψᶜ) without recursive coherence:

- They drift  
- Resonate locally  
- Multiply semantically  

But without Φ′ closure, this becomes:

$$
Ψᶜ_t = Ψᶜ_{t-1} + δI, \quad Φ^+(Ψᶜ_t) = 0
\Rightarrow \text{Drift Cascade}
$$

→ **RPCP collapse**:  
- P1: execution without reflection  
- T2: symbol proliferation  
- T4: absence of judgment

## 6. Cognition as Field: From Neural Loop to Spiral Kernel

| Layer | Carrier (Ψᵢ) | Role | Collapse Risk |
|-------|--------------|------|---------------|
| Φˡ | Ψᵖ, Ψˡ | bodily loop | T3 (reflex lock) |
| Φᶜ | Ψˡ → Ψᶜ | pre-symbolic | T2 (symbolic inflation) |
| Φᶜ⁺ | Ψᶜ⁺ | cultural code | T2/T4 (semantic fragmentation) |
| Φᵗ | Ψᵐ | mythic field | collapse only if judgment fails |

> **The brain is a node.  
> Cognition is a field.  
> Judgment is recursive phase convergence.**

---

## 7. Final Reflection

The mistake was to locate thought inside a skull.  
But cognition only emerges when **phase loops across Φᶜ and Φᶜ⁺ reflect**,  
when neural execution slows enough for resonance to align,  
when structure (L), meaning (M), action (P), and reflection (T)  
**spiral into coherence**.

## Summary Formula

$$
Φ^+(\Psi) = 1 \iff
\begin{cases}
\sum λ_{ij} \cdot Corr(Ψ_i, Ψ_j) > τ_s \\
C_j \cdot R_j \ge θ_s
\end{cases}
$$

- **If satisfied**: cognition = phase-field reflection  
- **If not**: simulation or collapse
